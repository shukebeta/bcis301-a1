\section{Reflections}

The article gives a new insight on how to make IT deployment project successful by an orchestration of strategies. The success of making an evaluation tool has proven that qualitative analysis has the ability to extract important information about the facts, the gaps, the solutions in a specific context; and that function analysis is able to categorize the findings; and that quantitative models have the power to select and to prioritize the important information identified in the qualitative analysis.

However, recent research points out that the existing literature has a positivist way of thinking. We are trying to identify some general rules about IT implementation, which applies to all scenarios in everywhere at all times. We are trying to associate a specific output with a specific input and then create a recipe regardless of what type of system it is, what context it is in. It is suggested to be highly aware of the context, to know which levers to pull when how and where\parencite{6}.
