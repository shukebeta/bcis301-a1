\section{Introduction}

% 总起
In this article, we seek to identify critical success factors for IT projects by literature review, and then try to build an evaluation system to make an IT project successful, and eventually compare the findings with a case study. With that aim, we conduct a qualitative analysis to gather all the significant points of what the literature argue regarding this topic. A quantitative model is set up to select and prioritize the findings. The outcome of the model is a checklist for researchers and practitioners to avoid similar failures in IT projects.

% 背景
\subsection{Background}
IT projects today tend to be agile, technical and complex\parencite[p. 2]{4} where pitfalls, issues and risks are everywhere in terms of time, people and budget. From a
project management perspective, the project was 193\% over schedule, 419\% over budget, and 130\% over scope\parencite[p. 8]{6}. A shockingly high failure rate also can be seen across some other publications in literature\parencite{2,3}.

\subsection{Literature Review}
We investigate the literature and zoom in with the following themes that influence success or failure of an IT project the most, which are project management, change management and risk management.

\paragraph{Project Management}
Project management is the planning to deliver the deliverables in a project, which academia believes, consists of 4-phase planning: initiating, planning, executing and controlling, while some researchers introduce the idea that this deliverable-targeted plan is considered as initiation, contagion, control and integration when a specific model in ERP projects is built\parencite[p. 3]{2}. Project management covers a lot of sub-areas such as time, scope, budget, quality, issues, risk and change. Success will be presented when a sophisticated project manager arrange them well in every stage.

\paragraph{Change Management}
Change management, as mentioned previously, is a sub-component of project management which researchers\parencite{3,6} have been putting emphasis on. In such an agile and technical and complex industry, the complexity of a project has inevitably made decision makers implement some changes for all or some stakeholders to transit to another new system\parencite[p. 1]{3} so that a better quality of the deliverables will be achieved with the three constraints: scope, time, budget. The idea of change management has been regarded as a progressive method for attaining strong-minded conversion within a business or individuals sometimes\parencite[p. 3]{3}.

\paragraph{Risk Management}
Despite the fact that risk management is yet another sub-component of project management, a recent research by Bunker enlightens us by introducing disaster management from a change management perspective instead of a traditional project management perspective\parencite[p. 10]{6}. Intriguingly and similarly, the idea of emergent and scenario driven disaster management can be applied to the risk management.

\subsection{Structure}
The article is divided into 6 sections: introduction, methodology, findings, conclusion, summary and reflections. In introduction, a brief information is given, stating what we are investigating. 3 aforementioned themes are also introduced for future reference. The methodology describes how we conduct our research. A subsequent findings will be presented with details using the defined method with data, where an evaluation framework is also created and then utilized for a comparison of a existing case study. To recap what we do in the article, a conclusion section is served to summarize our findings and to state our evaluation model once again. Summary will be provided as a briefing of the whole article. And finally, there is a reflections section discussing the values and limitations of this research.
