\section{Summary}

In this article, we have reviewed a selection of literature on what makes IT deployment project successful by two sets of resources in 2 phases. 4 primary themes are identified: control, people, process and structure. Control means the control of dynamics when running the project in the full life cycle of a project, especially the control of risk, or any other variables that are not static or predefined; process is a theme that relates to workflow, how to invent and organize steps to accomplish a goal; people is related to the skills of stakeholders in ICT projects where information should be successfully sent and perceived, professionalism should be shown and etc; structure means the structure of an organization.

To provide a practical tool for evaluating how possible an IT deployment project is going to succeed, we have created a mark sheet based on the combination of selected data in Phase 1 and 2. The mark sheet puts more emphasis on how to control dynamics(primary theme: control) and on how to deal with stakeholders(primary theme: people), which is agreed to our findings in literature.
